!!! question "Description"


    Hooray! It is the first time that Kunming holds an ICPC regional contest. Suppose that everything goes on
    well and the Kunming Regional Contest is held each year. In which year will the x-th Kunming Regional
    Contest be held?
    
    As Ben is going to take part in ICPC Asia Regional Kunming Site 2077, he wants predictions like suitable for writing $suitable\ for\ writing\ codes$or will $get\ accepted\ for\ every\ problem$ . He has found that the more times the substring $ac$  occurs in the concentration of all $N$ outputs, the luckier he will get in the contest. But as the contest is coming soon, he only has time to modify at most $K$ outputs of the computers in the predict system.
    
    As Ben is busy hacking into the system, could you tell him how to get the most $ac$ substrings after his modification?
